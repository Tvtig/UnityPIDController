# UnityPIDController
Creating a PID controller in Unity

I made a missile and applied a PID controller to it. I found an implementation of the PID control loop over here: https://forum.unity.com/threads/rigidbody-lookat-torque.146625/#post-1005645
which is what I based my implementation on. 

An explanation and demo can be  found on YouTube here: https://youtu.be/roxhVW3KeRY
